# Prosper Loan Dataset Analysis
## by William Orona


## Dataset

The Prosper loan dataset contains information on over 100000 borrowers from Prosper, a peer-to-peer lending company that facilitates the borrower and lender relationsip.  There are 81 features to this dataset.  Only a few of the features will be examined as seen in part one of the project.

## Summary of Findings

There are three methods that Prosper uses to rate borrowers.  Credit Grade or Prosper Score (depending on the date), and Credit Score are all approximately unimodal.  Most loans are on a 36-month term although 12- and 60-month terms are also available.  Most loans are in good standing (Completed, Final Payment in Process, or Current) and a smaller amount are cancelled, charged off, or in default.  Most loans are for debt consolidation.  Homeownership among borrowers is about split evenly with a slight majority being homeowners.  Median monthly incomes are around 5k and are positively skewed.  Overall the best predictors of having a loan in good standing are having a higher monthly income, being a homeowner, and having a good Credit Grade, Prosper Score or Credit Score.

## Key Insights for Presentation

- Homeowners and those with higher monthly incomes are the best candidates for loans.
- Homeowners have higher Credit Grades, Prosper Scores, and Credit Scores.
- Applicants who are homeowners and have higher Prosper scores also borrow more money.
- Higher income and higher Prosper Score applicants take shorter terms on loans.
- Homeowners tend to have higher incomes as well as higher Credit Grades.

In summary there is nothing surprising about the best loan applicants, they tend to have more assets, more cashflow, and higher ratings.
